# WebGame

I just want to make a basic game. I'm planning on using DOM elements instead of
`<canvas>`-drawn stuff.

This project is in a stage of research before making a proof of concept. As
part of this, **security-related updates, including updating dependencies, is
_not_ a priority.**

## To get this up and runningâ€¦

In a terminal, run the following inside of this directory.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
$ npm run dev
```

You can also look at ./package.json for more scripts.

This app is built using [Vite](https://vite.dev).
